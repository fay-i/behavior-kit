# bk-plan — The CONTEXT (Research Only)

When researching codebase context for a feature:

1. Read the constitution at `.behavior-kit/memory/constitution.md`
2. Read the spec at `specs/NNN-feature-name/spec.md`
3. Use the plan template at `.behavior-kit/templates/plan-template.md`
4. Explore the existing codebase: patterns, conventions, relevant files
5. Write the plan to `specs/NNN-feature-name/plan.md`

## Rules
- Document EXISTING patterns, not proposed ones
- Reference snippets come from EXISTING code only
- Open questions must include a proposed answer

## Forbidden
- Inventing data models or schemas
- Proposing API contracts or endpoint shapes
- Suggesting project structure or new directories
- Writing new code or pseudocode
- Making architectural decisions not already present in the codebase
