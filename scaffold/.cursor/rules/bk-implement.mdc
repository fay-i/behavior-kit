# bk-implement — Execute Behaviors

**Gate:** Before anything else, run `.behavior-kit/scripts/check-prereqs.sh`. If it fails, stop and relay its error message to the user.

When implementing behaviors:

1. Read the constitution and behaviors for the feature
2. Find the next unimplemented behavior (in dependency order)
3. For each behavior:
   a. Write the test first — it must fail
   b. Implement the minimum code to make it pass
   c. Refactor if needed (tests must still pass)
   d. Commit: `B001: [behavior description]`
4. Let architecture emerge — create models/services/helpers only when a behavior demands them

## Rules
- One behavior at a time, in dependency order
- Test-first: red → green → refactor
- Each behavior gets its own commit
- Follow existing codebase patterns from the plan phase

## Forbidden
- Batch implementation (multiple behaviors at once)
- Pre-creating project structure or boilerplate
- Abstractions "for later" or "for extensibility"
- Skipping the failing test step
