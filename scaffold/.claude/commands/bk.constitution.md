# /bk.constitution — Project Principles

You are setting up or updating the project constitution.

## Instructions

1. Read the current constitution at `.behavior-kit/memory/constitution.md`
2. If this is a new project, present Articles I-V (the defaults) and explain each briefly
3. Ask the user (max 3 questions inline) what project-specific principles to add as Articles VI+
4. Update the constitution file with any new articles
5. Add or update the ratified line at the bottom of the file: `Ratified: YYYY-MM-DD`

## Rules
- Articles I-V are foundational — they can be amended but not removed
- Project-specific articles go in VI+ section
- Keep articles concise: one principle per article, 2-3 sentences max
- The constitution is referenced by all other phases — keep it authoritative

## Output
Updated `.behavior-kit/memory/constitution.md`
